# Matching Pipeline

Pipeline matching tidak boleh hanya mengandalkan LLM.

Use:

```txt
Filter → Retrieve → Rule Score → AI Rerank → Save Recommendation
```

## Filter

### Candidate-to-job
```txt
- CandidateProfile must be CONFIRMED
- Job must be ACTIVE
- User must not be member of job company
- Candidate must not already apply
- Recommendation must not be rejected recently
```

### Company-to-talent
```txt
- Job must be ACTIVE
- CandidateProfile must be CONFIRMED
- Candidate user must not be company member
- Company must not already invite candidate recently
```

## Rule score
```txt
Skill match: 40%
Experience match: 20%
Location/work preference: 15%
Salary fit: 10%
Portfolio/history: 10%
Risk adjustment: 5%
```

## Action threshold
```txt
score >= 85:
Strong recommendation, notify user/company.

score 70-84:
Save recommendation, show in dashboard.

score < 70:
Ignore.
```
# Retrieval-first model usage

Matching applies deterministic hard filters and documented rule scores before
any model call. Vector retrieval narrows the candidate set. Only the reduced
set may use a cheap reranker, and borderline conflicting signals may escalate.
Broad candidate/job retrieval never invokes an LLM.
